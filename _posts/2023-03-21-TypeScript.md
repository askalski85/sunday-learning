# Goal

Learn basics about TypeScript in order to bootstrap myself in GitHub Actions development. I will be focusing
on the new things, and might skip some parts of the courses to use my time more efficiently. 

After course I would like:
- understand basics of the TypeScript
- learn some best practices about the TypeScript
- be prepared to contribute to GitHub TypeScript Actions
- create an Action interacting with GitHub API
