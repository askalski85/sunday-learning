# Goal

Learn basics about TypeScript in order to bootstrap myself in GitHub Actions development. I will be focusing
on the new things, and might skip some parts of the courses to use my time more efficiently. 

After course I would like:
- understand basics of the TypeScript
- learn some best practices about the TypeScript
- be prepared to contribute to GitHub TypeScript Actions
- create an Action interacting with GitHub API

# Outcome
The course [TypeScript Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/typescript-essential-training-14687057/learning-typescript?autoplay=true&u=2074018) was COMPLETED. The 2 hours of plain theory + time needed for hands on excersizes sums up to a complete 8 hours of training. The unfinished courses will be promoted to other training day.

I did learn during this training how to bootstrap a new TypeScript and most of the basic TypeScript elements. I must admit that TS is a powerfull tool for writing Javascript applications. I still need more hands on the decorators and working with metadata of types to feel more confident, I did struggle a little bit with 2 last excersizes of the course.
I also learned that it is relativelly easy to bootstrap yourself to work with TS easly, hovewer it requires time to get used to its the most powerful features. TS leaves in the Javascript ecosystem that means there is relativelly large level of complexity related to the range of possibilities how you can orchestrate your app, and very customizable version support influencing the huge variety of configuration options developers should be at least aware of in order to build, run and use the written code.
